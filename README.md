A collective to gather data & testimonies on Muslim Jammu genocide carried out by the Dogra state in 1947 in J&K.

`Genocide`

    The U.N convention of 1948 defines genocide as, "Acts commited with intent to destroy,in whole or in part, 
    a national, an ethnical, racial or religious group."
  
`Ethnic cleansing`

    The U.N commisionof experts define ethnic cleansing as, "Rendering and area ethnically homogenous by using
    by using force or intimidation to remove from a given area persons of another ethnic group or religious group."
    
 
The events that occurred in Jammu 1947 were a genocide as it gains its conceptual horror percicely because of the exterminated nature
of the Holocaust. Hitler wanted the Jews exterminated, not just driven out. Same is the case in the Jammu Genocide, the Dogra ruler 
Hari Singh wanted the Muslims of Jammu exterminated, he saw it to be the final solution of his political policy.

During the genocide, Dogra ruler Hari Singh wanted to completely exterminate Muslims, but he also sponsored ethnic cleansing in Jammu.

    The Mass murders in Jammu between Oct-Nov 1947 were calculated, planned and targeted, 
    with intent to destroy the Muslim population.
